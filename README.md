# Trovia --- Data Extraction and Management

This is a 2-part project. This repository focuses on extracting and managing data extracted from client files of Trove, a voxel MMO. The actual website code is in [a separate repository](https://github.com/ngaionice/trovia-s).

## Current progress

Currently, item, recipe, bench/workstation, collection and English language files parsing have been implemented. 

## To-do:

- Parse gear files
- Create a text UI to edit and manage existing entries.

## Possible extensions

- create a market tracking bot using OCR
- create a Discord bot for easy querying in Discord
